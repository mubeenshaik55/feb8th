        <br><br>
        
        
        <h3><b>Introduction</b></h3><hr>
        </center>
    
    <p>In the previous chapters, decisions models have been modeled based on the
economic point of view of the problem expressed mainly through quantitative
values and, in some cases by qualitative representation. The economic perspective draws unique coherence from economic assumptions of rational
behavior and it draws predictive power from strongly valid rules of influence
that employ mathematical or logical operators. Because the decision must be
expressed in a way that is compatible with the rules of inference, great
simplicity, and structure are required. In strategic decision making problems
great effort has been directed toward relaxing the mathematical constraints,
while retaining the economic — logic inference.<br>
Another important aspect to be considered is that in both theoretical and
practical decision-making models, fixed numbers of decision alternatives or
prefixed value of parameters have been considered. The major inputs to the
analysis of an econometric model of decision-making process are subjectiveprobabilities, utility values, and decision tree structures. Individuals may differ
in their subjective value of probabilities, their utilities of outcomes or in their
perceptions of the subsequent actions available. Strategic decision problems
involve not only one person’s opinion but involve a group of individuals
belonging to different classes and levels of interests inside and outside the
organization. No longer is the problem concerned with the selection of the
preferred alternative of one person. The analysis must be extended for a group
of decision-makers, each one exhibiting a certain preference structure, perceiving different consequences, and corresponding to a diverse set of interest
and responsibility. In some cases, depending on the number of persons
involved as well as on the nature of the decision problem (for instance,
promoting or hiring persons or, electing the president) it will be necessary to
adopt a voting system.<br>
How can different groups of individual affect a decision-making process? In
this chapter, we consider some behavioral aspects of individuals and group of
individuals that may affect a decision-making process.<br>
Behavioral perspectives of competitive decision-making are neither as well
articulated nor as complete as those of economic view. In behavioral views
cognitive limitations and the use of mental effort are emphasized. In contrast to
the rational approach of the economic frame, the behavioral views acknowledge that players may adopt different kind of rationality.</p>
    
    <center><h3><b>Individual and Group
        Behavioral Models</b></h3><hr></center><br>
    
    <p>Behavioral theory, adopted by the social sciences, reminds us that competition
which occurs in practice does not take into account just systematic and logical
decisions about wins and losses. The behavioral perspective examines which
attitude an administrator or a business assumes when faced with a given
situation. It is a way of explaining how the decision alternatives were selected
to formulate the strategy. It also works to minimize the influence of the
subjective determination of the qualitative and quantitative values of the
parameters involved.<br>
In general, strategic decision-making is a procedure for making decisions
working against some competitor or against the state of nature. The states of
324 Shimizu, de Carvalho and Laurindo

nature or the scenarios that can occur involve risk or uncertainties with regard
to market behavior, climatic influences, available capital, etc. A company
should have knowledge about the possible scenarios and the risks built into
these scenarios and choose a decision alternative.<br>
A competitive situation, or one of conflict, occurs when the result of a
decision is influenced by decisions made by other participants. Game theory,
formulated by Von Neumann and Morgenstern (1944), analyzes decisions
made where conflict exists. Game theory examines actions and reactions to the
existing alternatives in order to analyze and plan a competitive strategy. It
allows the administrator to analyze the systematic mode of wins and losses
resulting from a given action, as well as the possible wins and losses of the
competitor.<br>
Administrators’ behavior often does not rigorously obey the principles of game
theory. This stance could bring about beneficial results in some cases. Experimental studies reporting on situations, where a player, with no knowledge of
game theory or behavioral theory, plays against an adversary, are related by
Day and others (1997). To illustrate the complexity of the behavioral perspective we show an extension of the Prisoner’s Dilemma game, called the Social
Dilemma game by Raiffa (2002).<br>
</p>
    <h4><b>The Prisoner’s Dilemma Game</b></h4><hr>
    <p>In a two persons non-zero sum game between two people, gain f1
(i,j) = aij of
player 1 and gain f2
 (i,j) = bij of player 2 are different when player 1 chooses
strategy i and player 2 chooses strategy j. In this case, the sum of the gains aij
+ bij is different from de zero.<br>
The value of the game is defined by the equilibrium point orsaddle point, which
is the point (i*, j*) which satisfies the equalities:<br><br>
f
1
 (i*, j*) = Maxi
 f1
 (i, j*) and<br>
        f
2
 (i*, j*) = Maxj
 f2
 (i*, j)<br><br>
The point of equilibrium is the point (i*, j*) which provides the greatest gain for
player 1 as well as player 2, and is the most convenient point of gain for both
players. Note that, if one of the players moves away from this point, while the
adversary remains at this point, this player’s gain is diminished. However, this does not always occur as we can see in the problem known as the Prisoner’s
Dilemma.</p>
        <P><em>The Game</em><hr>
Two prisoners who are accused of the same crime are kept in separate cells and
are being interrogated separately by the police.<br>
            &emsp;If <em><u>both prisoners confess </u></em>to the crime, both will be sentenced to 10
years in prison.<br>
          &emsp;  If <em><u>neither of the two prisoners confesses</u></em>, the police, using circumstantial evidence can only sentence them to 2 years.<br>
           &emsp; If just <em><u>one of the prisoners confesses</u></em>, this prisoner will receive, as a
reward, a light sentence of one year in prison and the other, who did not
confess, will be &emsp;sentenced to 12 years in prison.<br>
Since the years in prison are penalties (and not gains), they are represented by
negative values and we can determine the equilibrium point of the game.</P>
    
    <img src="Screenshot%20(45).png"><br>
       <p> This example is a game between two persons with different gains (two person
nonzero sum game). The following observations can be made. The equilibrium
point, which theoretically would be the best decision for both prisoners,
corresponds to the decision (Confess, Confess) with a penalty of (-10,-10)
marked with asterisks (*).<br>
Nevertheless, the best decision (lighter penalties) for both prisoners would be
(not confess, not confess) with penalties (-2,-2), that is, 2 years in prison for
each.<br>
    
    This example shows that the best solution is not always obtained through a
mathematical principle of the equilibrium point type and that it is preferable to
           choose a decision where there is A SATISFACTORY AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE TWO PARTIES.</p>
    
    <br><br>
        <h3><b>The Social Dilemma Game</b></h3><hr>
    <p>This game, adapted from Raiffa (2002), is a generalization for N-persons, of
the Prisoners’ Dilemma game, where each participant can take one of two
actions: Cooperate (C) or Not Cooperate (NC). The rules of the game are:<br>
• &emsp;the game is played only once;<br>
• &emsp;no type of communication is permitted among the players;<br>
•&emsp; the action (C or NC) taken by each participant is known only to the game
instructor. The instructor communicates to the participants only the total
number of actions C and NC;<br>
•&emsp; the gains (in dollars) are: each NC players wins $(X = a value that
depends on the number of Cs) and each C players wins $ (Y = number
of Cs less 0.3x N).<br><br>
For example, in the case of N = 100 persons, suppose that the number of Cs
is 20. Each of the 20 C players loses $ (20 – 0.3x 100) or $ (-10), paying a
total amount of $200 which will be distributed among the 80 NC players. The
parameter 0.30 can be adjusted by the instructor. The C players generate the
capital to be divided among all.<br>
Now let’s allow reserved communication among the competitors (private
choice) before the game. The number of C or NC will depend on the private
communications. Nevertheless, if the communication is done in an open mode
(public choice), and each player knows who is C or NC, then the number of
C’s should increase.<br>
This game can be illustrated like a problem of birth control among the
population. Each family decides how many children it will put in the world. What
is the perspective for these children to have good quality of life? Should one
family have many children? How about the others families? What is the size of
population that planet Earth can adequately sustain? The game indicates the
need for negotiation among the participants, and that many questions remain
unanswered.</p><br><br>
    

        <center><h3><b>Methodologies Used in
            Group-Decision-Making</b></h3><hr></center>
        
        <p>Organizations make decisions in a group, due mainly to two reasons (Mallach,
2000):<br>
• &emsp;task related reasons: have to do with functional demands and techniques
which make it impossible for a single person to make a decision; and<br>
• &emsp;organizational reasons: which demand that certain individuals participate
in the decision making process due to the functional, structural and legal
organization of the company.<br><br>
Involving lots of people in the decision making process provides a greater basis
of experience, knowledge, and creative insights. It is intuitively reasonable that
the chances of overlooking possible events and possible courses of actions are
diminished in group-decision-making. The synergy of individuals may make the
overall quality of the group decisions greater than the sum of parts. The
creations of juries, panels and cabinets as ways of reaching decisions can be
seen to be based on this promise.<br>
However, if the opinion and values of individuals differ, how should the
differences be resolved? Difference of opinion may inhibit the expression of
critical ideas, resulting in an incomplete survey of alternative courses of action
or choices. Techniques to enhance group’s creative potential and interaction
such as Delphi, SODA (Strategic Options Development and Analysis), and
even the brainstorming process are widely used.<br>
The main difference of a group activity from an individual activity is the
opportunity for interaction among the group members, which enriches the
discussion and the analysis of the problem and provides a more objective
choice of alternatives to resolve the problem. Today, the richness deriving from
interaction can be obtained in various ways, since we have gotten beyond the
phase of meeting around a table or telephone consultations and conventional
mail, and we have the technology of e-mail, audio, and video conferencing.
Consultations, information surveys, mergers, and big business deals can take
place by means of group decisions with no need for the parties to be physically
present at the same place.
        <br>Some of the well-known group-decision methods are: (Warfield, 1976;
Poulton, 1994):<br><br>
•&emsp; brainstorming,<br>
•&emsp; Q-sort method,<br>
•&emsp; Delphi method,<br>
• &emsp;NGT – Nominal Group Technique,<br>
• &emsp;SODA – Strategic Options Development and Analysis, and<br>
• &emsp;GDSS – electronic meetings via video conferencing and e-mail using
Work Flow system.<br><br>
        </p>
        <br><br>
        
        <h3><b>Brainstorming
</b></h3><hr>
        
        <p><em>Brainstorming</em> is a meeting held to extend the discussion of a given problem
stimulating the creativity and the discovery of new solutions or new directions
to the problem. The informal type of discussion helps greater participation of
the members of the group but a good control of the discussion as well as the
documentation of important facts and results are essential.
</p>
        
     <h3><b>Q-SORT</b></h3>  <hr><br> 
        
        <p>Q-SORT is a group decision process where each participant structures the
decision problem, sorting a set of declarations according to his or her
preference. Each participant receives a set of cards containing the declarations
about the problem. A scaling measure is used to guide the sorting process of
the declarations. The main advantage of this procedure is that it can be repeated
many times using different sorting criteria for the problem</p>
        
        <br><br>
        <h3><b>Delphi</b></h3><hr><br>
        <p>Delphi is known as a methodology useful to generate, clarify, structure, and
organize a set of ideas. The methodology collects and evaluates information or
expert’s opinion with respect to a main subject. It is not allowed for persons
of the group to maintain communication among them. A supervisory teamselects a group of 30 to 100 experts giving to each expert a questionnaire based
on the most significant answers received, the supervisory team prepares a new
questionnaire to be distributed among the same or a new group of experts. The
process continues until the supervisory team evaluates that a significant and
structured set of answers has been received to solve the problem.<br>
Main characteristics of this method, based on description presented by
Goicoechea et al. (1982), are:<br><br>
•&emsp; the method can be applied to small or large groups;<br>
• &emsp; face-to-face contact is not necessary, and in many cases not recommended;<br>
• &emsp; relies on written responses;<br>
• &emsp; respondents can be at different locations;<br>
•&emsp;  may take more than 6 weeks to complete the decision process;<br>
•&emsp;  group decision is made through aggregation of individual judgments,<br>
usually after three or more rounds of distribution and analysis of questionnaires.
The execution of Delphi is made through the following sequential steps:<br>
1. &emsp; Develop the Delphi question that must be clearly and comprehensively
formulated, reflecting the objective of the problem to be solved.<br>
2.&emsp;  Select and contact participants that will be interested in the problem being
examined, and with minimum level of expertise necessary to deal with the
problem.<br>
3.&emsp;  Select a group of respondents among the participants contacted in step
2.Suggested number of the sample group is 30 persons, but it can be more
or less than 30 persons, depending on the problem to be analyzed.<br>
4.&emsp;  Develop questionnaire number 1 and test. The purpose of this questionnaire is to identify issues. This questionnaire should be tested on a small
sample of persons that are not part of the respondents. After the test, the
questionnaire is sent to the respondents.<br>
5&emsp;  Analysis of the questionnaire number 1. A decision-making staff prepares
a concise list of items identified in the answers of questionnaire 1, and a
summary of comments made by the respondents.<br>
        
      6. &emsp;Develop questionnaire number 2 and test. This questionnaire asks for
comments expressing agreement, disagreement or new questions about
the summary list prepared in Step 5 and sent to the respondents.
Respondents are asked to rank the issues of the list according to the level
of importance.<br>
7.&emsp; Analysis of questionnaire number 2. The staff prepares a summary of the
comments and counts the number of votes according to the rank attributed
to each item of the questionnaire number 2.<br>
8./9.&emsp; Develop questionnaire number 3 asking to do comments about the votes
received by each item, and give a final vote for the items presented.<br>
10.&emsp; The staff prepares a final report that must contain: the purpose of the
decision, all the intermediate results, and the final decision based on the
aggregation of individual votes collected in step 9.
The final report should be discussed and approved by a representative
committee formed by members of respondent groups. For purposes of
feedback and closure, participants should be given a copy of the final report.  
        
        <br>     </p><br><br>
      <h3><b>NGT</b></h3><hr>
        <p>NGT-Nominal Group Technique is a technique similar to Delphi, used for
more complex problems to be solved by a small group of persons through faceto-face contact. NGT usually can be done in 1 to 2 hours, whereas Delphi may
take 6 or more weeks to complete.<br>
Steps to conduct this technique are:<br><br>
1. &emsp;Leader gives each participant (5 to 9 persons) a written copy of the
question or problem being considered.<br>
2.&emsp; Participants write their own idea or answer to the question or problem
presented.<br>
3.&emsp; The results of group thinking are presented, recording each idea on a flip
chart to avoid duplication. The leader may merge similar ideas forming a
new idea, with the agreement of the group. Discussions are not permitted
during this step.<br>


4. &emsp;Each idea written on the flip chart is sequentially presented and discussed.<br>
5. &emsp;Preliminary vote of item importance is requested. Individual judgments of
each idea are expressed by a numerical ranking system and an average
value of the group preference for each idea will be defined. This average
value serves to express the mathematical evidence of the increase or
decrease of a group’s preference.<br>
6.&emsp; New discussions and new voting are permitted.<br>
7. &emsp;Final vote.<br><br>
During the step 3 and 4, the leader passes out 5 to 9 cards to each individual.
Each individual is then asked to make a priority list containing a list of 5 to 9 most
important items. Evidence indicates that individuals can accurately rank items
of lists of this size.</p>
        
    <h3><b>Strategic Options Development and Analysis (SODA)</b></h3> <hr>   
       <p>SODA is a methodology oriented to structure a complex problem with the
support of a reduced number of persons. The basic tools used are: the
cognitive map that helps to identify the objectives of the problem, the keyideas that directs the decision process, and the actions to be taken to solve the
problem. An interactive software called COPE-Cognitive Policy Evaluation
is used to give support to the decision process.</p> 
        
        <h3><b>GDSS</b></h3><hr>
        <p>Group Decision Support System or GDSS is a system whose design, structure,
and utilization reflect the manner in which members of a group interact to
choose an alternative of decision. The system should have technological
support for communication, file sharing, modeling activities in group, aggregating individual perspectives to form a group perspective, and other facilities that
permit interaction within the group. The GDSS can encompass all the sectors
of an organization or only certain activity sectors, with the possibility of
expanding the participation of individuals according to the functional level of the
sectors involved. The GDSS is programmed to accept appropriate input data,
to analyze the objectives (such as productivity, profitability, etc.) and to
provide solutions to the selected problems, generating the appropriate reports.
<br>
GDSS may be concerned with the problem of communication media richness.
Media richness is defined as the potential information-carrying capacity of a
data-transmission medium. Different types of media, differing in their richness,
may be appropriate for different types of tasks. For instance, according to
Mallach (2000), face-to-face contact is the highest ranked medium in richness,
followed by video conference, audio conference, real-time electronic chat, and
finally, electronic mail. Electronic mail is ranked as the medium with lowest
richness. In the face-to-face contact, GDSS must consider that participants
should be in the same place and they should work at the same time. In the
case of a video, audio conference as well as real-time electronic chat,
participants may be in different places but they should work at the same time.
Using electronic mail, participants may be in different places doing work at
different times.<br>
Authors (Mallach, 2000; and Turban & Aronson, 1998 ) report the following
three general types of GDSS:<br><br>
            &emsp; <b>Communication Management System:</b> provides communication flows
by means of facilities to store and exchange messages. Common examples
of this type of system are the electronic mail packages.<br>
             &emsp; <b>Content Management Systems:</b> provides automatic routing of messages according to the contents in a standardized way.<br>
             &emsp;<b> Process Management Systems: </b>provides important aid in both individual and group decision making process controlling: the pattern, contents, timing, and flow of the information exchange. Control of pattern and
contents of the message can be made by forms represented by different
types of documents. Control of timing and flow can be made by a script
that defines the routing of the form. A Work Flow system, considered as
an “intelligent electronic mail” is an example of this type of GDSS.<br><br>
These different types of GDSS can be used to manage differences of opinion,
focus on the goal of the strategic decision, control the time factor, lead to
objective analysis and judgments. The following Case Study One serves to
illustrate the application of group-decision-making methods.</p><br><br>
        
<center><h3><b>Decisions that Depend on the
Behavior of Persons</b></h3></center>   <hr>
        <p>Decision models suppose that the decision maker resolves a problem by
choosing the best alternative in terms of gain or profit. In Decision Analysis
Theory and Game Theory this aspect is rigorously obeyed, even though in the
majority of cases the formulated alternatives are simplified or condensed
versions of the possible states of nature. In real-life problems, we also need to
take into consideration the behavior of the individuals or organizations involved
in the decision. Several authors (Cohen et al., 1972; Takahashi, 1997) present
their research results involving the problem of behavior in decisions. We can
classify decision problems according to the behavior of persons or organization
as:<br><br>
            a. &emsp;<b>Decision for the Complete Resolution of the Problem.</b> A decision is
made to choose one of the possible alternatives, which proposes to
resolve the problem completely. All decision models from Game Theory
and Decision Analysis pertain to this category.<br>
            b. &emsp;<b>Decision by Oversight</b>. In this case, the decision is made in a superficial
or negligent way without any criteria for analyzing the problem. As an
example, we cite the case of hiring someone without examining their
resume, or without having them tested or submitted to any training.<br>
            c.&emsp; <b>Decision by Flight.</b> Encompasses problems approved (or abandoned)
due to difficulty in appropriately appreciating and resolving them, since
they involve conflicts of interest, lack of objectives, lack of interest, lack
of time, etc. The adoption of changes suggested by an anonymous letter
could serve as an example for this type of decision.<br><br>
These three types of situations can be represented by the garbage can model
shown in the section titled Garbage Can Model.
</p>
     <h4><b>Garbage Can Model</b></h4> <hr>
        <p>The garbage can model proposed by Cohen et al. (1972) pictures the problem
of decision-making as enormous garbage can where problems to be resolvedare put. Well-structured problems or those with a higher priority are resolved
and taken out of the can. The other problems are taken out after a superficial
examination or are taken out of the can because they are taking up space. Many
neglected problems remain on the bottom of the garbage can, which requires
the periodic emptying.<br>
The garbage can model is made up of the following elements:<br><br>
            1. &emsp;<b>Decision Mechanism:</b>is a structure or instance for deciding a problem,
spending a certain amount of ENERGY, according to the difficulty or
interest in resolving this problem. Examples: decision making meetings,
hiring committees, committees for firing or promoting employees, parliament, congresses, etc.;<br>
            2. &emsp; <b>Participants:</b> are people or organizations that are part of the decisionmaking mechanism and spend a certain amount of ENERGY (time,
knowledge, money) to try to resolve a problem;<br>
            3.  &emsp;<b>Problems:</b> are proposals presented to the decision mechanism;<br>
            4. &emsp;<b> Solution to the Problem:</b> decision alternatives chosen for each problem.
The occurrence of oversight or flight-type decisions can be linked to the greater
or lesser importance or priority attributed to a problem. These decisions may
occur due to the existence of the phenomenon called organizational anarchy.
According to Cohen et al., organizational anarchy may be the result of the
existence of many problems which are difficult to describe in a precise way.<br><br>
Some reasons for the existence of organizational anarchy are:<br><br>
1.  &emsp;decision participants lack clarity in defining and selecting problems;<br>
2. &emsp; difficulty in describing and applying a technology or former experience to
the solution of the similar problem;<br>
3. &emsp; existence of multiple restrictions or conditions imposed on the problem
which disperse decision maker’s attention;<br>
4. &emsp; irregular, sporadic, or inadequate participation of persons or group of
persons so that the level of energy available to resolve problems is uneven.
Organizational anarchy can be found, for instance, in some university (or some
public agency) where:</p><br><br>
        <p><em>Table 13.1. Some rate of occurrence of decisions of the oversight or flight
type, in different positions and age groups (% and total number of
persons) (adapted from Takahashi, 1997)</em></p>
        <img src="Screenshot%20(46).png"><br>
        
        <p>1.&emsp; Several decision-making organisms (schools, departments, committees,
projects, etc.) are created and their problems are thrown in the garbage
can represented by the university.<br>
2.&emsp; The methods employed (such as teaching, research, evaluation methods,
etc.) provide uncertain results for the development of the university.<br>
3. &emsp;Professors, students, employees or community representatives participate in an irregular fashion in the decision making organisms of the
university.<br><br>
Table 13.1 presents the partial result of a research to evaluate the number of
persons (according to position and age group) that have had experience in
adopting a decision of this type (flight or oversight).
According to this research, high rates of decision by oversight or flight are
observed in the first age intervals for heads of division, department, and
supervisor/managers groups. Inside regular employees, the rate of decision by
flight or oversight increases according to the age interval. Answers from groups
with less than 10 persons were discarded.
</p>
        <center><h3><b>The Impact of Psychological Types</b></h3></center><hr>
        <p>In the behavioral model of decision making, it is important to consider the
behavior of each person or group of persons regarding the psychological preference of each person. The Swiss psychologist Carl Gustav Jung (1975-
1961) created and developed a theory of psychological types in an attempt to
explain the apparent differences existing in people’s behavior. Jung stated that
he began to construct his theory when he perceived the differences of
conception and behavior between him and his colleagues in analyzing the same
problem, and also observing the behavior of patients and other people. Jung’s
theory is based on the supposition that differences among individuals are
caused by the different ways that people use their minds. In using the mind, a
person becomes involved with the following mental activities:
        <br>   <br>
        
            •&emsp; <b>PERCEPTION: </b>contact with events or collecting information without
concerning oneself with its organization or purpose, and   <br>
            • &emsp; <b>JUDGMENT:</b> information is “received” via a process of organizing,
planning, and analysis to draw a conclusion.  
For Jung, these two activities constitute the innate preferences of individuals
who prefer one of the two activities.   <br>   <br>
The process of PERCEPTION can be affected in two distinct and opposite
ways:   <br>   <br>
            • &emsp; <b>SENSING:</b> when attention is directed to what can be observed or what
is real, and   <br>
            • &emsp; <b>INTUITING:</b> when perceiving the relationships among events, persons,
or ideas, observing what is behind them.   <br>   <br>
The process of JUDGING can take place in two distinct ways:   <br>   <br>
            • &emsp; <b>THINKING: </b>takes the pros and cons into consideration to try to come
to a conclusion in a logical manner, but can neglect some existing
relationships among persons, or   <br>   <br>
            • &emsp;<b> FEELING: </b>takes sentimental values into consideration and can neglect
logical thinking.   <br>
        
        Jung believed that these four processes of using the mind can be applied to
events from the outside as well as the interior world, and thus added the
following types:<br><br>
            •&emsp; <b>EXTROVERTS:</b> individuals who direct their thinking and energy to
events from the world outside, acting and reacting with it, or<br>
            • &emsp;<b>INTROVERTS:</b>those who receive information from the outside, as well
as the interior world, through contemplation and reflection, keeping this
information inside themselves.<br><br>
Each of these psychological types affects a person’s behavior in many areas,
including decision-making.<br>
The MBTI method (Myers-Briggs Type Inventory, ® trademark of Consulting

        <center><h3><b>Negotiation Model</b></h3></center><hr>
        <p>The combination of the economic perspective of game theory with the behavioral perspective of group-decision-making seems to lead to a complex
decision. Examining the strengths and weaknesses of the two decision perspectives, one sees that problems related to interaction among competitors did not
merit due attention.<br>
Groups of persons have to recognize that they are in a dispute to choose a
decision alternative based on allocating finite resources and that this dispute
needs to be resolved by negotiation. Negotiation can be about just one specific
item (such as the sale price of a product) or, it can involve several items (such
as positions, salaries, the number of hires, etc.) Factors such as the place of
the negotiations, number of participants, time available, etc., can vary and
influence the results of every negotiation.<br>
A third perspective, represented by the perspective of co-evolution by Day et
al. (1997), and by negotiation model of Raiffa (2002) (see the Social dilemma
game presented in this chapter), allows one to predict the interactions among
participants, which leads to a more balanced adaptation of the competition.
This third perspective permits the creation of a model where the player does not
compete necessarily against a hypothetical or logically declared adversary.
Participants in this game act as members of an organism where mutual
rationality co-exists and all manage to survive and evolve within a limited and
adverse environment. The perspective of co-evolution and the negotiation
model are concepts formulated, in an independent way, by Day & others and
by Raiffa.<br>
Co-evolution is a concept based in evolutionary biology which is used in
connected systems, such as the effect of a virus on living beings, the genetic
system, etc. The co-evolution or negotiation model can be considered a
perspective to view business as a type of system in evolution, where the result
of one action can affect other results and all the results can co-evolve.<br>
The economic perspective of win or loss of game theory, as well as the
behavioral perspective shows us that by considering just one of these perspectives, certain basic knowledge can remain hidden. The third perspective can
remove or clarify these obscure components. Table 13.3 lists the characteristics and relationship of these three perspectives.<br>
Case Study Two illustrates the needs for negotiation among different departments concerning enterprise’s planning and budgeting.<br><br>

        <center><h3><b>The General Multi-Objective and
Multiple-Decision Problem
</b></h3></center><hr>
        <p>A general, multi-objective, and multiple-decision-making problem introduces
a great deal of complexity in comparison with a single decision maker in which
the problem is concerned with the selection of a most preferred alternative by
this decision maker. There exists a growing interest in group-decision-making,
but the set of several factors and situations contributes to illustrate the
difficulties to develop a model suitable for most significant real-world applications.<br>
A formal model of the general multi-objective and multi-decision problem
presented by Goicoechea & others (1982), is useful to visualize some of these
difficulties.<br>
Let A = { a1
, a2
, …, a
p
 } represent a set of feasible alternatives available to a
group of N persons represented by i, (i = 1, 2, …, N). Let x = { x1
 , x2
 , …,
x
p
 } be the set of consequences associated with the set of alternatives.
Let us assume that, also there exists uncertainty associated to the occurrence
of each alternative. Let fij(x) represent the subjective probability density
function attributed by each person i for the consequence of the alternative j.<br>
Let ui
 (x) be the vector of utility function of the person i, W(x) is the utility
function associated for the group of N persons and Fj
 is the joint probability
density function of the group for the alternative j.
        
        
        In the group decision model, the group should select the alternative aj
 that
maximizes the group’s expected utility, i.e.:<br><br>
Max Ej
 (W(x)), j A<br><br>
where:<br><br>
Ej
 (W (x)) = W (x) Fj
 (x), for all x;
W(x) = G(u1
(x), u2
(x),…, uN
(x)) and Fj
 (x) = f ((fi j
(x), f2 j (x),…, fN j(x)).<br><br>
The group-decision-making problem consists of finding an aggregation rule G
for the group utility function W and an aggregation “f” for the joint probability
density function Fj.<br>
An important point to be considered is whether or not it is possible to determine
a function W that is satisfactory to the group of individuals. This issue is related
with the problem of the satisfaction of each person of the group regarding the
efficiency of the voting process used to express his or her individual preference,
and was examined by Arrow’s Impossibility Theorem for a specific type of
aggregation rules called social welfare functions. Analysis of problems found
in some models of voting systems leading to the Arrow’s impossibility theorem
            is presented in following section.</p>

<h4><b>Group’s Preference and Arrow’s Impossibility Theorem</b></h4> <hr>       
        
        <p>Today, people are more and more often requested to participate in some type
of electoral process, independently of age or occupation, since elections take
place in schools, departments, communities, and in some cases even in the
family environment. There are also elections to choose representatives for the
city, state, and nation.<br>
However, the choice of a satisfactory voting process is a controversial matter
due to the conflicting interests that come into play and due to the difficulty of
effecting an analysis and comparative evaluation of the existing voting systems.<br>
We present some models of voting system that underlie the existing electoral
processes, which will also permit a more structured analysis of their strengths
and weaknesses. The voting systems presented here were adapted from the
        
        
        work presented in Konno (1997), with theoretical bases from Fishburn and
Geherlein (1976), and Arrow (1976).<br><br>
            A. &emsp;<b>Multiple Choice Voting System</b>
Let’s consider that there are m candidates (or alternatives of choice) C1
,
C2
,...,Cm
 and n voters E1
.,E2
,...,En
. Each voter classifies all the candidates
or alternatives of choice in a certain order of preference. For example, a
certain voter establishes that the preference is C3
 > C1
 > Cm
 >...> C5.
In the preference of each voter, for each pair of candidates (Ci
 , Cj
) one
of the preferences Ci
 > Cj
 or Cj
 > Ci
 occurs. Candidate Ck
 will be
considered the winning candidate by simple majority if Ck
 is the
candidate most preferred in relation to all the remaining candidates. It is
irrefutable that this process chose the best candidate. However it is not
always possible to find this winner due to the occurrence of ties in voter’s
preference. The occurrence of ties among the candidates is due to the
problem of cyclical ordering.
This phenomenon (ties among the candidates) is known as theCondocert¶s
paradox. Condocert, a French mathematician, discovered that the number of ties among the candidates due to cyclical ordering increases
according to the number of candidates. For instance, simulation studies
showed that, for 5 candidates the probability of occurrence of ties is 0.25,
while for 10, 20 and 30 candidates this probability increases to 0.49,
0.68 and 0.76, respectively (Konno, 1997).<br><br>
            B.&emsp;<b> Two-Stage Election With Multiple Candidate List</b>
A two-stage election with the elaboration of a list of multiple candidates
appears to be a lot better than the previous system.
This kind of election is held as follows:
STAGE ONE – The voter votes inq preferred candidates from among the
m existing candidates and
STAGE TWO – The s most voted candidates in stage one are submitted
to new voting and this time t among the s candidates are chosen. The
candidate with the highest number of votes at this stage wins.
Simulation results testing various combinations of values (m,q,s,t) reported
that the greatest percentage of winning votes occurs when: q m/2 ;
s = 2 e t = 1 (Konno (1997)). Thus in STAGE ONE, half of the candidates
        
        
        
        should be voted, and at STAGE TWO the two most voted candidates are
separated and voted.<br>
            C. &emsp;<b>Election by Approval or Rejection of Candidates</b>
Knowing that there is no perfect election system, according to Arrow’s
Theorem, the following system was proposed by Brams and Fishburn
(1982):<br><br>
            <em>EACH VOTER VOTES FOR AS MANY CANDIDATES AS SHE OR
HE WISHES AND THE CANDIDATE WHO OBTAINS THE GREATEST NUMBER OF VOTES WINS.</em>

        <br><br>
        This system has the advantage of including all the features of the other
voting systems.<br>
            D. &emsp;<b>There is No Perfect Voting System</b>
The mathematician, economist and social scientist Kenneth Arrow, made
a deep analysis of the principles that should guide a perfect democratic
society. He studied the existing electoral processes and managed to
formulate the Arrow’s Impossibility Theorem.
            <br><br></p>
        
        <em>Arrow¶s Impossibility Theorem ± The Impossiblity of Generalizing a
Social Decision Process By Vote
</em><hr>
        <br><br><em>&emsp;"In a social decision process, where society and each individual or
voter can fully prioritize candidates according to his or her
preference, there is no perfect decision process which satisfies the
principle of equality and independence of votes.´
</em>
       <br><br> 
     <p>This principle, formulated and demonstrated in 1951, had a great impact on
those who believed that democracy is the perfect form of government and that
a social-decision-making process which obeyed the principles of democracy
would be perfect. Due to this principle, Arrow was the third winner of the Noble
Prize for Economics.

Decisions in Perspective</b></h3></center><hr>
        <h4><b>Case – Group Decision to Organize a New MBA Course</b></h4><hr>
        
        <p>ABC University is reviewing and reorganizing the structure and the contents of
its MBA courses for the next academic year. Particularly, the University’s
MBA courses committee is interested in a new course embodying important
environmental problems according to the interest of state and local government
agencies and local enterprises.<br>
Considering the multidisciplinary nature of this type of course and the innovative
aspects expected for this new course, the committee decided that the purpose
and the structure of the course, as well as the organization of curriculum and the
contents of disciplines should be organized based on the suggestions received
from a wide range of persons interested in this new course.<br>
A task force indicated by the committee to conduct this consulting work
decided to organize a group-decision-making process using the advantages
and flexibility of the existing GDSS to meet a fast, efficient, and transparent
group-decision procedure. The committee decided to apply group-decision
techniques, NGT and/or Delphi techniques, supported by an electronic meeting
system available in the University’s GDSS.<br>
According to the University’s regulation for a MBA course, a new course will
be approved when a proposal with the following topics are presented:<br><br>
a. &emsp;purpose and description of the course;<br>
b. &emsp;types and qualification of the students to be enrolled;<br>
c. &emsp;a curriculum composed by 10 to 15 disciplines;<br>
d. &emsp;each discipline must be described by a short syllabus of up to ten lines,
and 5 bibliographical references; and<br>
e. &emsp;desired academic and professional background of at least two instructors
for each discipline<br><br>.</p>
        

        <h4><b>Case – Negotiated Decisions in the Operations
Department</b></h4><hr>
        <p>The president of a manufacturing company noticed that, reviewing the earnings
reports of the current quarter, the profits were down once again. This was the
third successive quarter in which profits were dropped. During a meeting with
the vice president of operations, the president observed that the primary cause
of poor profits could be found in the operations department. Product inventories were up, and the unit production cost had increased over the past year. The
quality of the service had not deteriorated over time but union relations had
been getting worse during the past months. The vice president of operations
replied that production costs could be cut and product inventories reduced, but
not without adverse effects on customer service, quality, and union relations.
He suggested that the problem could be solved by more aggressive marketing,
since sales had dropped along with profits.<br>
The president and the vice president of operations realized that the problem
went deeper than simply cutting back present operations costs and improve
profits. They decided that, to prevent this situation from occurring again in the
future, the company must do a better job of planning, decision-making, and
managing within the operations function. The company must develop a system
of decision making in operations to ensure that the operations department
would consistently meet its cost, quality, and customer-service objectives.
This decision-making system must include better forecasting methods, more
effective control over product inventories, better process design decisions, and
improving quality control systems. The vice president of operations argued that
he needs more decisions from the top, about how much the cost, quality,
delivery, or flexibility objectives would be emphasized.<br>
The president replied, “We’ve recently completed a five-year corporate plan.
Doesn’t it help answer your questions?”<br>
The vice president observed that the corporate plan focuses almost entirely on
market analysis and financial planning. It’s presumed that operations will meet
the marketing and financial goals which have been set. The market strategy and
the financial plan are not always consistent with operations strategy and are not
formulated at the same time. Revision of the corporate plan or the operations
goals is essential to keep a dynamic operations strategy, which is an integral part
of the corporate plan.
        
        
        At this point the marketing vice president walked into the office and said: “I’ve
just returned from our national sales meeting and, based on more recent market
research and government decisions, it appears that sales will be up even beyond
our previous forecast. Last year we lost sales because of stock-outs of certain
key product models, and this hurt us more than we expected. As a result, I’m
raising the forecast for next fiscal year from 100,000 units to 110,000 units.<br>
The president interrupted, “Just two months ago, we sat here in this office and
agreed on the forecast of 100,000 units. We simply do not have the plant
capacity to produce 110,000 units. And what are we going to do with all of the
inventory if we add the capacity and the forecast does not materialize?”<br>
The marketing vice president replied: “Suppose for a moment the new forecast
is correct, what are our options for more plant capacity? Do we have time to
build a new plant?”<br>
The operations vice president observed that: “I think our methods of forecasting are too crude, and something must be done about them. As we all know,
the market is very dynamic in our business. I’m not sure how well the new
computerized quantitative methods available for forecasting will work for us,
but perhaps we should investigate them.”<br>
Operations management seeks to produce goods and services at low cost, but
with good quality, and acceptable, flexible, delivery deadlines. It is believed
that these goals are reached by employing modern equipment, a good information system, satisfied workers, and a team of competent administrators.
However, these objectives conflict among themselves and it is not possible to
optimize these four dimensions (cost, quality, delivery, and flexibility) at the
same time. A negotiated decision is always necessary.<br>
To take precautions against this type of situation (consecutive drops in profits),
the vice president of operations must have an efficient system to review and
improve the planning, programming, and control procedures of production. It
is necessary to identify the critical production points, utilizing the company’s
best available information. How much should one sacrifice the other three
objectives to reduce production costs? It is necessary to adopt a strategic
corporate decision to focus on the critical production points and better adjust
the four objectives.<br><br>

        <center><h3><b>Conclusion: What Constitutes a
Good Strategic Decision?</b></h3></center><hr>
        
        
    <p>Three decision-making models were analyzed in this chapter: the first model
was based on the economic win/lose perspective of game theory; the second
was based on the behavioral view illustrated by the garbage can model; and
finally, the third model was based on a perspective of negotiation and coevolution. An attempt to understand the characteristics and feasibility of the use
of group-decision methods (NGT, Delphi and GDSS) has been made.<br>
In any of these three perspectives, group decisions may lead to the need for a
decision using a voting system. Some voting systems used by groups of persons
in the choice of individual preference were analyzed. Despite the problems
existing in each voting system, and the objection raised by Arrow’s Impossibility Theorem, election is an important process for selecting strategic preferences. For example, according to Konno (1997), the election system by
approval and rejection of candidates is being adopted more often in elections
for boards of directors and councils of class associations and scientific societies
in various countries. This system is particularly recommended for electing
directors of universities and associations because it avoids the need for a
second round.<br>
Finally, what constitutes a good strategic decision?<br>
Summarizing the results of a decision based on the models and examples shown
in this and in the previous chapters, we may think about certain personal
preferences and organizational biases a decision analysis should overcome.
The following features of a good decision, based on Bunn (1984), might be
appropriate in an executive’s evaluation of strategic-decision-making process.
A good strategic decision is the decision that:<br><br>
1. has a favorable response from superiors and colleagues;<br>
2. achieves a quick committee consensus;<br>
3. provides the ideal outcome for the possible understanding of the problem.<br><br>
According to these features, the decision-making process will not solve a
problem for us. It can provide us with the means for explicitly structuring and
restructuring, analyzing and reanalyzing the problem under different assumptions and criteria.
        
        
        We should have gained a greater understanding of the problem situation and
sharper intuition in the sense to eliminate obvious incoherence in our reasoning.
We have to analyze a problem according to different points of view to see what
the outcomes are for different ways of analysis.<br>
Starting from basic and moving to more advanced models, we will have
sufficient information and good sense to sit in a negotiation table, and in this way
determine which course of action is most justifiable.<br>    </p>
